Words In Motion

#project overview

Our lives have changed forever and affected the concept of community since the COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020. For me community existed through the family, friends, and coworkers I would see on a daily basis. Community is very important to me, and the pandemic was challenging to me for not being able to see everyone.

 The set of lyrics displayed in this shape poem are from the song "Head In the Clouds" by 88Rising and Joji. This song reminds me of my friends when we hung out, going on drives and concerts before the pandemic. There's a lot of words pertaining to motion and emotions verbs and adjectives in the song. During the pandemic I moved away from the City and moved to the East Bay so I could not see my friends or coworkers as much as I had before. We only saw each other virtually, but I was used to seeing everyone in person. The vibe of the song is very chill and floaty, and I was reminded of how much I missed the general community of people I would normally see everyday.

The meaning behind these lyrics in "Head in the Clouds" make me feel like a good time that I don't want to end. The rhythm of the song is very soothing and tranquil. This song triggers fond memories with my friends and makes me reflect on how I don't take the people I have around me for granted.
